             <p>I am Chua Zi Jun, and I would like to tell you more about myself.
                I am a dedicated person that enjoy studying. The knowledge and perspective 
                that my dedication had given me has strengthened my reading skills and presentation abilities.
                I have had many opportunity in my Nitec (Aerospace Avionics) and Higher Nitec (IT System and Networking) years, 
                experiencing the working life from internship.Through this opportunity, 
                i was able to gain experience handling many different task at once. 
                This flexibility will help me in the classroom, where there are many 
                different personalities and learning style.
                The reason I made such a change jumping from engineering to an IT 
                courses was due to curiosity.I love to explore which is why i chose an all-rounder field.
